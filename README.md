Implementation of a Kalman Filter algorithm in both Python and C++ for tracking of position and velocity with acceleration variance.
Integrated C++ code with Python using pybind11.
Created tests using pytest to ensure accuracy of both implementations. 
Created data visualizations with matplotlib to demonstrate filter performance and confidence intervals.
